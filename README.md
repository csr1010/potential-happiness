# plus points

Diversed and cooperative team 

Each member on team learned and contributed to the project

written from scratch with on the spot learning (quick learning and adaptability)

tried new technologies which most of the team has never worked before

Very useful because

- don't have to remember any slack commands

- enjoy talking to JIRA in natural english

- don't have to switch to JIRA WEB UI

- can simultaneously talk to a real person and bot at the same time.
